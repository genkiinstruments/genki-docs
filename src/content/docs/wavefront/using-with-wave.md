Wave has 3 buttons you can reach with your thumb. Each button has a certain function.

The LED display indicates whether Wave is active or not.

A stable horizontal line indicates that Wave is inactive while interactive horizontal and vertical lines indicate that Wave is actively sending data to Wavefront.
