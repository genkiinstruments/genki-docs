  <TabItem label="iOS">
You can connect Wavefront to your iOS device. It works on an app-to-app basis so you need to connect Wavefront through the application you want to use it with - not through the regular Bluetooth Settings.

1. Turn Wavefront on. Make sure Bluetooth is turned on on your device.
2. Navigate to the app you want to use Wavefront with.
3. Find the app's settings (usually a wrench or a gear icon) and find Bluetooth MIDI (as long as the app supports Bluetooth MIDI devices).
4. You should see Wavefront on a list of Bluetooth MIDI devices. Press connect.
5. If the app you're using does not provide an option to pair Bluetooth MIDI devices, download [this](https://apps.apple.c/src/app/midimittr/id925495245) application and use it to connect to Wavefront.

You can connect external Bluetooth MIDI (BLE MIDI) instruments to your Wavefront.

2. Keep your instrument close to Wavefront as Wavefront connects to the Bluetooth device nearest to it.
3. Press the button on Wavefront.

To be able to connect other BLE MIDI instruments other than Wave you need to [update Wavefront to its newest firmware](/wavefront/update).
