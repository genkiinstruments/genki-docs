## Rename Wave

To rename Wave right-click on a connected "Wave", select 'Rename' and type in a new name.

Renaming Wave can come in handy when you have more than one Wave, or if you simply want to identify your own Wave from the ones of your friends.

## Wave on Right or Left index finger

Depending on what you are doing it might come in handy to have Wave on your left index finger instead of the right one.

Wave is symmetrical so this is easily possible. In order to flip the screen as well as the motion detection algorithms press "R" (Right). It should now read "L" (Left). Repeat to change it back.
