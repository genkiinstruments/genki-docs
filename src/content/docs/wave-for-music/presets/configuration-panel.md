There you can configure the preset to your liking.

<summary>Preset name</summary>

On the left side of the panel you'll see the preset number and preset name. To rename the preset; click the Preset name. You can now write a new name. Press Enter when done or click with the mouse cursor outside the box.

<summary>Selecting a plugin</summary>

Each preset can host its own plugin (VST3/AU). This way itâ€™s easy to move between plugins and sounds. To select a plugin click the box where it reads "Select Plugin". 

If the preset is already hosting a plugin the box will read the name of that particular plugin.

<summary>Auto activating a Preset </summary>

<details>
<summary>Relative vs Absolute</summary>

Within each preset you can decide if Wave uses Relative (Rel) or Absolute (Abs) movements. The default state for Wave is Relative.

Relative mode behaves in a way that when you deactivate a preset, no matter how you move your hand in between, when you reactivate it the ring will start tracking from the last position before deactivating.

The Absolute mode does the opposite. It keeps tracking your movements even if you've deactivated the preset, and "jumps" to the current value when you reactivate it.

Absolute is stuck in space, Relative moves with you.

<details>
<summary>MIDI channel</summary>
