1. To make sure Wave works with Live, navigate to the top left corner of your screen to Live → Preferences → Link MIDI. Make sure Wave (Bluetooth) has Track and Remote toggled on.
2. In Softwave solo the function you want to map. Make sure your function has a dedicated CC number or Note.
3. In Live navigate to MIDI in the top right corner, shortcut cmd+m (macOS) or ctrl+m (Windows).
4. Select the parameter you want to map.
5. Depending on which type of function you are mapping, move, tap or click on Wave to make the link.
6. Press MIDI again in Live. De-Solo the function. You should have mapped a function to a parameter in Live successfully.

:::tip
In order to map functions from Softwave to Ableton Live you need to attach a MIDI CC number to the function.

You can assign any CC number, but make sure each function has an individual number.
Softwave uses this number to communicate with your DAW.

Additionally you can assign:

1. PB (Pitchbend) to Tilt, Pan, Roll and Vibrato.
2. Notes (C, C#, D, E, F etc.) when using the Tap function.
3. Notes and Key commands/Shortcuts (cmd+T, R, f12 etc.) when using the Click function.
