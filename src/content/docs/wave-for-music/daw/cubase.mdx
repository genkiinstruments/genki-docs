1. To make sure Wave works with Steinberg's Cubase, navigate to the top menu of your screen to Studio → Studio Setup. The MIDI Port Setup window should have opened.
2. Find "Wave IN" on the list of devices and make sure "In 'All MIDI Ins' is enabled.
3. Cubase has mappings auto-assigned. In Softwave map the function you want to use to one of the following CC signals:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>CC number</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 1</td>
      <td>Modulation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 2</td>
      <td>Breath</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 4</td>
      <td>Foot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 7</td>
      <td>Main Volume</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 8</td>
      <td>Balance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 10</td>
      <td>Pan</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 11</td>
      <td>Expression</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 16</td>
      <td>Gen Purp1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 25</td>
      <td>Control 25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC 64</td>
      <td>Sustain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Wave should automatically control the selected CC in Cubase. 4. To assign Wave
to a 3rd party plugin, solo the function you want to map within Softwave. Make
sure your function has a dedicated CC number or Note (→ [see
Functions](/wave-for-music/functions/tilt-pan-roll/)) that is not already
auto-assigned in Cubase. 5. In the 3rd party plugin right click on the parameter
you want to map. Many plugins allow "MIDI Learn". Select "MIDI Learn" if
available. 6. Depending on which of Wave's functions you are mapping, move, tap
or click on Wave to make the link. 7. Now De-Solo the function in Softwave. The
function should be mapped to the parameter in the 3rd party plugin within
Cubase. 8. Repeat for other functions.
