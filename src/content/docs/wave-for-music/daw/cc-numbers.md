In order to map functions from Softwave to your DAW (such as Ableton Live or Logic Pro) you need to attach a MIDI CC number to the function.

:::tip
You can assign **any** CC number, but make sure each function has an individual number.

**Softwave uses this number to communicate with your DAW.**
:::

Some DAWs such as Cubase and Pro Tools have some of their CC values hard coded, so you can't use all of them.

Additionally you can assign:

1. PB (Pitchbend) to Tilt, Pan, Roll and Vibrato.
2. Notes (C, C#, D, E, F etc.) when using the Tap function.
3. Notes and Key commands/Shortcuts (cmd+T, R, f12 etc.) when using the Click function.
