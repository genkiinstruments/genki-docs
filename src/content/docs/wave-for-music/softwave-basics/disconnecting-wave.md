To manually disconnect Wave from Softwave you can any of the three:

1. Turn Wave off by holding the Up and Down buttons simultaneously.
2. Simply close Softwave.
3. To completely disconnect Wave you can navigate to Menu-&gt;Connect Bluetooth Device and press the "x" behind the connected Wave. This way Softwave will forget Wave.

:::tip[Auto-connect]
Softwave has a built in auto-connect feature, so the next time you open Softwave it will connect automatically to Wave unless you disconnect manually.
