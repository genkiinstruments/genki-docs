You can use two Waves within Softwave at a time - Wave **A** and **B** .

### Connecting a second Wave

To connect a second Wave to Softwave press **B** at the top left corner of Softwave.

Then follow the same steps as before when you connected the first Wave.

### Changing Wave **A** to **B** and vice versa

To change Wave **A** to **B** select Wave **A** and drag it down under **B**. 

The two connected Waves should change roles.

### Mapping functions to B

Automatically all new functions you add to your preset are mapped to Wave **A**.

To map functions over to Wave **B** press the **A** in the lower left corner of the function window. It should turn from brown to white and read **B** instead of **A**.

Repeat for all functions you want to map over to **B**.
