Wave can be used as a stand alone MIDI controller with your iPad, iPhone or Android device or by using WIDI Master by CME which allows you to connect Wave straight to your hardware instrument, without the need of a computer.

As a default Wave only has one preset in Standalone mode and the CC numbers Wave sends, and each movement's range is predetermined.

You can configure how Wave behaves in Standalone mode, creating presets and customising everything to your liking, by using[ Softwave's Standalone mode editor](/wave-for-music/standalone-mode/standalone-mode-editor/), on your mac or windows computer.

### Standalone Mode default values

The LED display indicates whether Wave is active or not. A stable horizontal line indicates that Wave is inactive while interactive horizontal and vertical lines indicate that Wave is actively sending data to your device.
