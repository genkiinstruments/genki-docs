'Edit mode' allows you to adjust presets on Wave it self, without going back to the computer.
'Edit mode' consists of a main menu, which is an overview of the preset's functions and submenus for each function, where you can adjust them.

'Edit mode' does not allow you to create new presets, it merely allows you to edit the presets you've already created using Softwave's Standalone mode editor.

You can MIDI Learn CC and Program Change values, manually change CC and note values, adjust movement range, sensitivity, output range and more.

### RE/AB - Relative, Absolute

You can decide if a preset uses Relative (RE) or Absolute (AB) movements. The default state for Wave is Relative.

Relative mode behaves in a way that when you deactivate Wave, no matter how you move your hand in between, when you reactivate it Wave will start tracking from the last position before deactivating.

The Absolute mode does the opposite. It keeps tracking your movements even if you've deactivated Wave, and "jumps" to the current value when you reactivate it.

Absolute is stuck in space, Relative moves with you.

Click MIDDLE button to change.

Movement Range (Tilt, Pan &amp; Roll)

### Details

Adjust the movement range of a function by clicking the MIDDLE button and then trace the desired range of it out in the air. Click the MIDDLE button again when finished.

The default range of each movement is from 0 to 90 degrees. The range of a movement controls its sensitivity. If the range is small the movement becomes more sensitive, and if the range is large the movement will be less so.

The position where you start tracing will become the movements starting point when you Reset the movements (long press on MIDDLE button).

You can for example start in the middle, trace upwards and then move past your starting point when you trace downwards. This way the starting point will be in the middle of the movement.
