Tap lets you change any surface into a trigger pad, triggering notes or samples while tapping your finger. The Tap function is velocity sensitive.

## Tap sensitivity

You can change the sensitivity of the Tap function by dragging the line up or down, making it longer or shorter. A longer line makes Wave more sensitive and a smaller one less so.

The tap sensitivity is shared between all Tap functions controlled by the same Wave, so if you change the sensitivity for one Tap, it will automatically update the sensitivity of other Taps.

## How to MIDI map?

In order to map a tap trigger to your DAW you need to connect a CC value or a note to each function.

When mapping, Solo the function you want to map in order for Softwave to only send the signal for that particular function to your DAW. When the parameter you want to map has been selected in your DAW tap your finger on a surface in order for the MIDI message to register.
