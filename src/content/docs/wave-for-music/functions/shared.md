## Renaming a Function

To rename a function press its name, for example "Tilt" or "Roll", write in a new name and hit Enter. If the preset you're working within is hosting a Plugin you can not rename functions.

## Using two Waves

You can connect two Waves to Softwave at a time. Each Preset gives you an overview of all the functions you're using for both Waves at a time. Every new function is automatically mapped to Wave A.

If you want to map a function to Wave B press the "A" in the lower left corner of the function window. The function should now read "B" and be mapped to Wave B. Repeat for other functions you want to remap.
