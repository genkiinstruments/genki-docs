Wave is the ring that makes working from home easier. 

Wave connects to your computer via Bluetooth and comes with plug-and-play software that lets you seamlessly control your video calls, presentations, music and assign custom shortcuts with a single click. Wave has three customizable buttons that you can program to use with your favorite applications like Zoom, Spotify, PowerPoint, Keynote and more. 

Wave's screen gives you visual feedback—so that you’ll always know when you’re on mute during a video call.
