Connect one end of the charging cable to Wave and the other one to a power source, such as your computer's USB port, in order to charge it. You may want to charge Wave before using it for the first time.

- A **full charge** takes 90 minutes and gives 8+ hours in constant use.

- A **quick charge** of 20 minutes gives you approximately 2 hours of use.

In order to maintain a good battery life, Wave must be charged regularly. If storing Wave for a long time, please make sure that the battery is charged above 70%.
