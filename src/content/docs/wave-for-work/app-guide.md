## Gesture Actions
**a.** To activate the Swipe Gesture press the icon for the middle button. The icon should change and have arrows on both sides of the ring.

**b.** Choose an action for both the Left and the Rigth Swipe.

**c.** The L and R simply stand for Left and Right Swipe.

**d.** When you have the Swipe Gesture selected the middle button performs as a mute/unmute button for the Gesture. If swiping doesn't work it might be that you simply muted the feature and need to press the middle button once to unmute it.
