In the Music mode you can use Wave to control an application's audio, whether you're using Spotify, iTunes Music or YouTube.

As a default the middle button lets you play and pause a track while the upper and lower button change songs. You can adjust the volume by holding the middle button while rotating your hand.

Wave will control the last selected audio application, just like the audio adjustment buttons on your keyboard.

## Features
* Start and stop audio
* Change between songs
* Mute audio
* Adjust Volume by holding middle button and rotating hand

## Customizing buttons
The default settings can easily be customized.

1. Click the action you want to change. For example "Next Song".

3. You're all set. In this example, every time you click the middle button, it mutes your computer's audio.
