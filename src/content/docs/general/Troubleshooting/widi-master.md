### I have connected Wave and Widi Master to Softwave, but no MIDI is sent to my synth.

1. Head to Menu â†’ Audio/Midi Settings...
2. Make sure both Wave and Widi Master are selected as MIDI inputs.
3. Also make sure the MIDI Output is set to Widi Master.

### My Widi Master does not receive MIDI when paired directly with Wave

Please try upgrading the firmware for your Widi Master and try again.
